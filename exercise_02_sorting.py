# Sorting
#
# This is designed to be super challenging!  Don't get sad if you can't work it out.
# You need to sort the list, so that it is all in ascending order.
# Try writing it out on paper first, take a break, write it in little pieces.
#
# To break it into little pieces, try sorting the list [5] (it is already sorted, as
# it only has one element.  Easy, right?  Next try with [5, 2].  Shouldn't be too bad.
# From there, try a list of three elements, and then any amount of elements!
#
# If you get really stuck, google bubble sort.
# If you need my help, save what you have, commit it, and send it to Github.  I'll have a look
# and give you some hints.

# 1.01

l = [1]

print(l == [1]) # should print out true. well, it is already sorted.


# 1.02

l = [5, 2]

# do stuff to l to sort it here

print(l == [2, 5])


# 1.03

l = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 0]

# do stuff to l to sort it


print(l == [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) # This should print out true!
